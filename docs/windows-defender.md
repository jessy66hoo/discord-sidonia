Windows Defender can be easily turned off and it won’t take more than a few minutes. In case the simple methods aren’t working out for you, we’ve listed the more in-depth ways how you can turn off Windows Defender on your computer. 

## Turn Off Windows Defender on Windows 10 / 11 
Turning off the Windows Defender will put your computer at risk if you don’t have any 3rd-party anti-virus program installed on your computer. But, if you do have it, turning off Windows Defender is safe. To turn off the real-time protection of Windows Defender on Windows 10 or 11, perform the following steps:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Click on Updates & Security.
3. Click on Windows Security from the left pane.
4. Click on “Virus & Threat Protection” and choose “Manage Settings” from the menu.

But, upon restarting your computer, Windows Defender would start on its own and will continue to protect the computer from any threats. And in the meantime, if any malicious files are detected, they will be quarantined and the users will have the option to either recover them or remove them permanently.
